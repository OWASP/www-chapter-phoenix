Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) and then contact the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
